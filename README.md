Project Setup
Running PHP Server
To run the PHP server, follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
Execute the following command to start the PHP server:
bash
Copy code
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
The PHP server will start running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Starting Vue Deployment
To start the Vue deployment, navigate to the resources/ directory of your project.

Open a new terminal window/tab.
Change directory to the resources/ folder:
bash
Copy code
cd resources/
Install the dependencies using npm:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Once the dependencies are installed, start the Vue development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run serve
The Vue application will be deployed and accessible at http://localhost:8080/.

Starting the Docker Database
To start the Docker container for the database, follow these steps:

Navigate to the docker/ directory of your project.
Start the Docker container by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
The Docker container will start running, and the database will be accessible according to the configuration specified in the docker-compose.yml file.

Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system before starting the container.

Additional Notes
Ensure that all the required dependencies and tools (PHP, Vue CLI, Docker) are properly installed on your system before running the commands mentioned above.
Customize the database configuration in the docker-compose.yml file as per your requirements.
You may need to install additional PHP extensions or configure PHP settings based on the specific needs of your project.
Make sure to run any necessary database migrations or setup scripts to initialize the database schema and tables.
Update any relevant environment variables or configuration files to ensure proper connectivity between the PHP application, Vue frontend, and the database.
Remember to provide clear instructions and prerequisites for others to follow when setting up and running your project.
